GraphM is a class that implements a directed, weighted graph. This class can
perform the Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from every node in
the graph to every other node in the graph. To use the GraphM class, please
include graphm.h in the driver file and compile graphm.cpp, nodedata.cpp, and
the driver file together.

GraphL is a class that implements a directed, unweighted graph. This class can
perform the depth-first search to print every node in the graph. To use the
GraphL class, please include graphl.h in the driver file and compile
graphl.cpp, nodedata.cpp, and the driver file together.

Both classes should be compiled with c++ 11 or higher.
